# Mutūn Web App

Web application for searching the mutun meta-corpus, drawing from the pioneering work of the KITAB/OpenITI project and al-Maktaba al-Shamela.

## About the App

Web app allows for searching tokens and roots of Arabic texts. The app is simply a react front end that utilizes an Opensearch backend for searching. Text data will be uploaded to a Zenodo repository once finalized.

## About the Project

The impetus behind this project grew out of frustration with the lack of any user-friendly way of accessing thousands of digitized texts in the KITAB/OpenITI project collected years ago. The majority of researchers, scholars, and readers don't have the technical knowledge to access let alone read and search these highly encoded texts. Mutūn is an answer to this problem by providing access to thousands of texts, many of which are not available in searchable corpora. Not only can users easily perform basic searches for words or phrases, but they can also save custom collections, past searches, and carry out complex queries that utilize both regular token search and root search.
